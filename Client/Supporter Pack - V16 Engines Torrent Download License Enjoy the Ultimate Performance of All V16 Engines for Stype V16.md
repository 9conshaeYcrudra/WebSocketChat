# How to Download and Install Supporter Pack - V16 Engines for Automation
 
If you are a fan of Automation, the game that lets you design and build your own cars, you might be interested in getting the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines DLC. This DLC adds the largest capacity engine configuration available in Automation, with a capacity range of 1.1L - 21.7L. While it is not giving players any direct advantage, it offers a nuanced alternative to V12 engines for very-high-end cars[^1^].
 
However, you might not want to pay the full price for this DLC, or you might not have access to the official Steam store. In that case, you might be looking for a way to download and install Supporter Pack - V16 Engines for free using a torrent file. This article will show you how to do that in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Find a reliable torrent site
 
The first thing you need to do is to find a torrent site that has the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines torrent file available for download. There are many torrent sites out there, but not all of them are safe and trustworthy. Some of them might have fake or malicious files, or they might be blocked by your ISP or government. Therefore, you need to do some research and find a reliable torrent site that works for you.
 
One way to do that is to use a torrent search engine, such as Torrentz2 or Torrents.io, that aggregates results from multiple torrent sites. You can enter the keyword "SupporterPackV16EnginesTorrentDownloadLicense" and see what comes up. Alternatively, you can use a VPN service or a proxy server to access some of the popular torrent sites, such as The Pirate Bay or 1337x.

## Step 2: Download the torrent file
 
Once you have found a torrent site that has the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines torrent file, you need to download it to your computer. Usually, you can do that by clicking on the download button or the magnet link on the torrent site. However, before you do that, make sure you have a torrent client installed on your computer, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent. A torrent client is a software that allows you to download files from other peers using the BitTorrent protocol.
 
After you have downloaded the torrent file or clicked on the magnet link, your torrent client should open automatically and start downloading the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines files. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders (people who have the complete files and are sharing them), this might take some time. You can monitor the progress of your download on your torrent client.
 
## Step 3: Install Supporter Pack - V16 Engines
 
When your download is complete, you should have a folder containing the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines files on your computer. To install them, you need to copy them to your Automation game folder. The location of your game folder might vary depending on where you installed it, but usually it is something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Automation.
 
To copy the files, you can use a file manager such as Windows Explorer or Finder. Simply drag and drop the files from your download folder to your game folder. Alternatively, you can use an extraction tool such as WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files from a compressed archive (such as .zip or .rar) and then copy them to your game folder.
 
After you have copied the files, you should be able to launch Automation and enjoy the Supporter Pack - V16 Engines DLC. You can check if it is working by going to the engine designer and selecting V16 as an engine configuration option.
